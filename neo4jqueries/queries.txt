create indexes:

CREATE INDEX ON :Bank(name)
CREATE INDEX ON :Client(name)

Fetching all ING entities
match (a:Bank)
Where a.name starts with "ING"
return distinct a.name


looking at all relations with ing with clients
match p1=(a:Bank)-[]-(b)-[]-(c)
Where a.name starts with "ING"
return p1

query to aggregate:
match (b:Client)-[r:SEND_TO]->(c:Client)
with b,c,sum(toInteger(r.amount)) as y
create (b)-[:SUM{total:y}]->(c)
